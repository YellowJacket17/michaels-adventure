/**
 * This abstract class defines base logic for a landmark (trees, buildings, etc.).
 */
public abstract class LandmarkBase extends Drawable {

    /*
     * A landmark represents something on the map that is part of the map's environment that takes up more than one tile
     * space and has layering effects (trees, statues, set pieces, etc.).
     *
     * Each type of Landmark (i.e., each Landmark subclass) has a unique ID defined in its subclass definition.
     * This ID is NOT unique for each Landmark instance; all Landmark instances of the same subclass share the same ID.

     * `numTilesRow` represents the number of tile rows that a landmark occupies/encompasses.
     * `numTilesCol` represents the number of tile columns that a landmark occupies/encompasses.
     * Note that a landmark does need to completely occupy a tile to occupy it.
     * For example, the top point of a tree could only actually cover half of a tile, but we would still include that
     * top tile that the point touches in our row count.
     *
     * `worldX` is the x-position in the world that the leftmost tile(s) of the landmark occupies/occupy (i.e., "root"
     * position).
     * `worldY` is the y-position in the world that the bottommost tile(s) of the landmark occupies/occupy (i.e., "root"
     * position).
     *
     * Note that there's an adjustment to the `worldY` coordinate when rendering a landmark.
     * Since a landmark's `worldY` represents the bottom-left tile it occupies, we need to effectively move the landmark
     * sprite "up" slightly (in the negative y-direction) when rendering since rendering is done in respect to the
     * top-left coordinate of a sprite.
     * In other words, if a landmark is taller than a tile, the y-position needs to adjusted when rendering.
     * If this adjustment were to not happen, then the top-left corner of a landmark's sprite would be in the same
     * position as the top-left corner of the bottom-left tile it's meant to occupy.
     * This would cause the entire landmark sprite to render "lower" on the map (in the position y-direction) than it
     * should.
     *
     * The collision array (`collision`) sets which tiles that a landmark occupies should have collision with an entity.
     * In other words, it marks the tiles occupied by a landmark that are considered to be solid.
     * The first dimension of this array represent columns.
     * The second dimension of this array represents rows.
     * In other words, data is stored in this array as [col][row].
     * Note that the collision array is only initialized to be as large as `numTilesCol` and `numTilesRow`.
     * The first row in this array represents the bottommost row of tiles that a landmark occupies/encompasses.
     * The second row in this array represents the row of tile one above (negative y-direction) the bottommost row.
     * And so on....
     * Columns are read left-to-right, starting with the column of the leftmost tile(s) that a landmark occupies/
     * encompasses.
     *
     * For example, let's say that a landmark is a square that encompasses four tiles.
     * The bottom-leftmost tile that the landmark occupies is the "root" location of the landmark (i.e., `worldX` and
     * `worldY`).
     * `collision[0][0]` would be the collision of the bottom-left tile location.
     * `collision[0][1]` would be the collision of the top-left tile location.
     * `collision[1][0]` would be the collision of the bottom-right tile location.
     * `collision[1][1]` would be the collision of the top-right tile location.
     *
     * Note that landmarks are intended to remain static (i.e., not change world positions once instantiated).
